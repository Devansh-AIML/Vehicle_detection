# Vehicle Detection System 🚗

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a computer vision application built with **Python** and **OpenCV** designed to detect and track moving vehicles in video feeds. It identifies moving objects by separating them from the static background using Background Subtraction techniques.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Real-time Detection:** Processes video frames to detect vehicles instantly.
* **Background Subtraction:** Uses the MOG (Gaussian Mixture-based Background/Foreground Segmentation) algorithm.
* **Contour Detection:** Identifies shapes to draw bounding boxes around moving vehicles.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python 3.12
* **Library:** OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
* **Algorithm:** Background Subtractor MOG/MOG2
